# Basic arithmetic operations ---------------------------------------------



# Objects in R ------------------------------------------------------------



## Vectors ----


### Exercise 1 ###

# Every time a section begins with "### Exercise 1 ###"
# there is a small problem that you should solve

# Generate three objects:
# a) a should contain the number pi (try out command pi)
# b) b should contain the numbers 1 to 10
# c) c should contain the multiplication of 1*pi, 2*pi, ..., 10*pi



## Matrices ----


### Exercise 2 ### 

# combine pi and the vector b in a matrix called m2 (column wise)
# calculate pi * b and add it to your matrix as an additional column
# Note: try to solve this task by only creating one object (m2).
# Call the result of 4*pi from the matrix



## Data frames ----


### Exercise 3 ###

# Select observations from df
# a) where y is greater than 20
# b) where x is greater than 1 and y is smaller or equal than 40



## Lists ----



## Functions ----



# Working with data frames ------------------------------------------------



## Summarizing data ----



## Missing values ----



## Recoding data ----


### Exercise 4 ###

# a) recode the 'survived' variable in the titanic dataset
#    to a new numeric dummy, where 1 indicates survivors and 0 non-survivors
# b) recode the 'class' variable in the titanic dataset
#    to a new dichotomous factor variable indicating "passenger" and "crew"
# c) generate a variable in students indicating the number of different 
#    softwares each of you have learned previously
