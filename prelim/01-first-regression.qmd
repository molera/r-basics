## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>. Hello this is nice. We can write some code. Add some comments.

\bar x = 1/N \sum x_i

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
# this is a usual comment

1 + 1

2 + 4
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: false

4 * 5

# this is a usual comment

```

# Load Packages and Data

First we load our packages. We'll add more later.

```{r}
#| warning: false
#| message: false

library(here)
library(tidyverse)
library(modelsummary)
library(marginaleffects)
```

Now let's load our data. We will use the script that we have already written.

```{r}
#| warning: false
#| message: false

source(here("code/01-load_anes.R"))

anes
```

# Presenting Regression Results

First we have to run a few regressions.

```{r}
m1a <- lm(misconf_russia ~ social + college +
            age + female + mode, data = anes)
summary(m1a)

m1b <- lm(misconf_russia ~ social + I(social^2) + college +
            age + female + mode, data = anes)
summary(m1b)

m1c <- lm(misconf_russia ~ social * college + I(social^2) * college +
            age + female + mode, data = anes)
summary(m1c)

```

## Regression Tables

```{r}
modelsummary(list(m1a, m1b, m1c),
             coef_map = c("social" = "Social Media Exposure",
                          "college" = "College Education",
                          "social:college" = "Social Media X College",
                          "I(social^2)" = "Social Media Squared",
                          "college:I(social^2)" = "Social Media Squared X College",
                          "age" = "Age",
                          "female" = "Gender (Female)",
                          "modePhone" = "Survey Mode (Phone)",
                          "modeVideo" = "Survey Mode (Video)",
                          "(Intercept)" = "Constant"),
             gof_map = c("nobs", "r.squared", "rmse"),
             vcov = "HC3")
```
